# Stable Diffusion

Create art with machine learning and GitHub Codespaces.

## Getting Started

1. [Create a Hugging Face account](https://huggingface.co/join) if you don't have one already
2. Sign in to your Hugging Face account and [generate a token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens#user-access-tokens)
3. [Create and set a `HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN` secret](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-your-codespaces/managing-encrypted-secrets-for-your-codespaces) within your individual account settings for Codespaces. 
Note: Ensure that your repository can access that secret. One way to check is by typing 'echo $HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN' in your terminal and ensuring that it's printed correctly. 
5. Open this repo in a GPU codespace and run all cells.
